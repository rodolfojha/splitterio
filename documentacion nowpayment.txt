Use cases
NOWPayments API
NOWPayments is a non-custodial cryptocurrency payment processing platform. Accept payments in a wide range of cryptos and get them instantly converted into a coin of your choice and sent to your wallet. Keeping it simple â€“ no excess.

Authentication
To use the NOWPayments API you should do the following:

Sign up at nowpayments.io;
Specify your payout wallet;
Generate an API key and IPN secret key;
Please note: IPN secret key may be shown fully only upon creation. Make sure to save it after generation.
Standard e-commerce flow for NOWPayments API:
API - Check API availability with the "GET API status" method. If required, check the list of available payment currencies with the "GET available currencies" method;
UI - Ask a customer to select item/items for purchase to determine the total sum;
UI - Ask a customer to select payment currency;
API - Get the minimum payment amount for the selected currency pair (payment currency to your payout wallet currency) with the "GET Minimum payment amount" method;
API - Get the estimate of the total amount in crypto with "GET Estimated price" and check that it is larger than the minimum payment amount from step 4;
API - Call the "POST Create payment" method to create a payment and get the deposit address (in our example, the generated BTC wallet address is returned from this method);
UI - Ask a customer to send the payment to the generated deposit address (in our example, user has to send BTC coins);
UI - A customer sends coins, NOWPayments processes and exchanges them (if required), and settles the payment to your payout wallet (in our example, to your ETH address);
API - You can get the payment status either via our IPN callbacks or manually, using "GET Payment Status" and display it to a customer so that they know when their payment has been processed;
API - you call the list of payments made to your account via the "GET List of payments" method;
Additionally, you can see all of this information in your Account on NOWPayments website;

API Documentation
Instant Payments Notifications
IPN (Instant payment notifications, or callbacks) are used to notify you when transaction status is changed.
To use them, you should complete the following steps:

Generate and save the IPN Secret key in Payment Settings tab at the Dashboard;
Insert your URL address where you want to get callbacks in create_payment request. The parameter name is ipn_callback_url. You will receive payment updates (statuses) to this URL address.**
Please, take note that we cannot send callbacks to your localhost unless it has dedicated IP address.**
important Please make sure that firewall software on your server (i.e. Cloudflare) does allow our requests to come through. It may be required to whitelist our IP addresses on your side to get it. The list of these IP addresses can be requested at partners@nowpayments.io;
You will receive all the parameters at the URL address you specified in (2) by POST request;
The POST request will contain the x-nowpayments-sig parameter in the header.
The body of the request is similiar to a get payment status response body.
You can see examples in "Webhook examples" section.
Sort the POST request by keys and convert the it to string using
JSON.stringify (params, Object.keys(params).sort()) or the same function;
Sign a string with an IPN-secret key with HMAC and sha-512 key;
Compare the signed string from the previous step with the x-nowpayments-sig , which is stored in the header of the callback request;
If these strings are similar it is a success.
Otherwise, contact us on support@nowpayments.io to solve the problem.

Usually you will get a notification per each step of processing payments, withdrawals, or transfers, related to custodial recurring payments.

The webhook is being sent automatically once the transaction status is changed.

You also can request an additional IPN notification using your NOWPayments dashboard.

Please note that you should set up an endpoint which can receive POST requests from our server.

Before going production we strongly recommend to test the endpoint by making a test request to it by yourself to ensure it's working properly.

Recurrent payment notifications
If an error is detected, the payment will be flagged and will receive additional recurrent notifications (number of recurrent notifications can be changed in your Payment Settings-> Instant Payment Notifications).

If an error is received again during the payment processing, recurrent notifications will be initiated again.

Example: "Timeout" is set to 1 minute and "Number of recurrent notifications" is set to 3.

Once an error is detected, you will receive 3 notifications at 1 minute intervals.

Several payments for one order
If you want to create several payments for one order, you should do the following:

Create a payment for the full order amount;
Save "purchase_id" which will be in "create_payment" response;
Create next payment or payments with this "purchase_id" in "create_payment" request;
Only works for partially_paid payments;
It may be useful if you want to give your customers an opportunity to pay a full order with several payments, for example, one part in BTC and one part in ETH. Also, if your customer accidentally paid you only part of a full amount, you can ask them to make another payment.

Payments
POST
Create recurring payments
https://api.nowpayments.io/v1/subscriptions
This method creates a recurring charge from a user account.

The funds are transferred from a user account to your account when a new payment is generated or a paid period is coming to an end. The amount depends on the plan a customer chooses.
If you specify a particular currency your customer should pay in, and their account have enough funds stored in it, the amount will be charged automatically. In case a customer has other currency on their account, the equivalent sum will be charged.

Here is the list of available statuses:

WAITING_PAY - the payment is waiting for user's deposit;
PAID - the payment is completed;
PARTIALLY_PAID - the payment is completed, but the final amount is less than required for payment to be fully paid;
EXPIRED - is being assigned to unpaid payment after 7 days of waiting;
Please note:

Subscribtion amount will be deducted from your sub-user balance in any currency available; i.e. if your subscribtion plan is set up for 100USDTTRC20/month, and your customer has 100USDCMATIC on balance, USDCMATIC will be deducted and transferred to your custody.

You can convert it manually using our conversions endpoints through api or in your Custody dashboard.

Custody
This section describes our custody feature.

If you prefer, you can set up a full-fledged billing solution. Our API allows you to create user accounts for your players with dedicated balance management for each one of them, transfers between these balances, direct deposits and much more in future.

In order to do that you need:

Create a user balance with "Create new user account" method. You can integrate this endpoint into the registration process on your service so upon registration, players will already have dedicated NOWPayments balance as your sub-user.
To show the balance at the frontend you can get it with "GET user balance" method. It will return you an array of user balances you can list in the back office.
To set up top ups, you can use "POST deposit with payment"; it will work as general white-labeled payment directly into user balance. You only need to show the user required for making a deposit information using the response of that endpoint. It's also possible to automatically credit it to player taking advantage of IPN system.
Managing debit and credit you are meant to use "POST deposit from master account" and "POST write-off" endpoints to make transactions from master balance to user balances, and vice-versa, enlisting all of these operations is possible using "GET transfer" and "GET all transfers" endpoints.
For payouts administration you will need to collect funds from your players' balance and withdraw it using payouts API.
POST
Create new user account
https://api.nowpayments.io/v1/sub-partner/balance
This is a method to create an account for your user. After this you'll be able to generate a payment(/v1/sub-partner/payment) or deposit(/v1/sub-partner/deposit) for topping up its balance as well as withdraw funds from it.

You can integrate this endpoint into the registration process on your service so upon registration, players will already have dedicated NOWPayments balance as your sub-user.

POST
Verify payout
https://api.nowpayments.io/v1/payout/:batch-withdrawal-id/verify
This method is required to verify payouts by using your 2FA code.
Youâ€™ll have 10 attempts to verify the payout. If it is not verified after 10 attempts, the payout will remain in â€˜creatingâ€™ status.
Payout will be processed only when it is verified.

If you have 2FA app enabled in your dashboard, payouts will accept 2FA code from your app. Otherwise the code for payouts validation will be sent to your registration email.

Please take a note that unverified payouts will be automatically rejected in an hour after creation.

Next is a description of the required request fields:

:batch-withdrawal-id - payout id you received in 2. Create payout method;
verification_code - 2fa code you received with your Google Auth app or via email;
In order to establish an automatic verification of payouts, you should switch 2FA through the application.
There are several libraries for different frameworks aimed on generating a 2FA codes based on a secret key from your account settings, for example, Speakeasy for JavaScript.
We do not recommend to change any default settings.

Plain Text
const 2faVerificationCode = speakeasy.totp({
      your_2fa_secret_key,
      encoding: 'base32',
})
